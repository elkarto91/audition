master will read the template, especially the header
apiVersion :v1 (it will look for kind named service)
similiarly for next item we add another
apiVersion : apps/v1
kubernetes will be more modular and custom; we can define a service
link (its an interface)
statefulset is a workload(it will called by service)
service will decide which pod should handle service
Deployment,Statefulset etc are abstractions to pods
if statefulset is down pvc wont go, becuase its another pod
pvc
pv
container
pod
stateful etc
interface service
job
stateful
deployment all have containers so they are workloads
selector and matcher are there for every workload
service has a label and a selector , selector will have label of the workload you want to attach
the service itself can create loadbalancer , any container i want to expose to publice i can use load balancer
node port can also be used to redirect ports
if worker nodes
podAffinity can be used to tell where to run a service
